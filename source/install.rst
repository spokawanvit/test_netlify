Installing instruction
======================

Linux-based OS
--------------
Notice that python library management through `pip` is no longer supported 
in most modern linux distro. I am currently using debian. To install the
sphinx, simply run `sudo apt install python3-sphinx`.

If you want to run sphinx with custom codes (for example, :code:`sphinxemoji`)
which is not supported in the current debian distro, you need to create virtual
environment which will allow you to install :code:`sphinxemoji` in that env.
