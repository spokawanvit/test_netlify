Getting started
===============
Here, I want to generate structure for toc tree containing :code:`overview`,
:code:`autogen` and :code:`conf.py`. I simply generate them using toctree
directive. Note that in previous section, I set :code:`maxdepth` of 2
meaning that the first depth of toctree in this section will show up in the
previous page. However, you're not limited to :code:`maxdepth` of 1 in this
page!

.. toctree::
   overview
   conf
   autodoc
